# Token Life-Cycle

1. **Release Phase:** Token is released and heavily advertised; pre-negotiated endorsements and stabilizing bids increase trading volume.

2. **Stealth Phase:** Artificial hype generated by creators has worn off and token has slipped under the radar. Price mostly moves within bounds of price-range established during release phase.

3. **Breakout Phase:** Token reaches organic popularity; price increases rapdily inside a short period of time, usually appreciating by a factor between 5 and 10 in value

Phase 1 usually lasts a maximum of 2-3 weeks and during that time slowly fades into phase 2. The stealth phase can last from weeks to years and may not end in a price explosion. Phase 3 often features a phasic meteoric price increase, catalyzed by currently high levels of *FOMO*, over a one- to three-month period.
